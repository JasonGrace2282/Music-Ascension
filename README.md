# Music Ascension
by Captains of Code <br/>

<h1>Game: Music Ascension </h1>
Problem Statement
People in class were struggling with music due to lack of music training earlier, or need a different style of teaching then classroom style - other apps may cost money or have ads, or arenâ€™t engaging-so we created this game to make learning music theory more fun.

<h1> How to Play?</h1>
When you open the file, you will be greeted with a screen that shows two buttons, Start and Credits. If you click on credits, you can see the image citations. However in order to start the game, you must click on start. After that, you can choose the level of experience you have with music theory. 

If you click beginner, you will see the topics covered in the beginner level (Note durations and Note on the staff).
If you click Advanced, you will see the topics covered in the beginner level (Time signatures and Dynamics and Articulations)

Once you click next, a map will appear, with different GPS markers indicating different levels. On each GPS marker, there is a symbol that represents the topic covered. Once you click on the level and topic that you want to learn about, a page with the notes will appear. This page contains all the information you will need to pass the level. 

Once you click next, you will be directed to a page which tells you the goal of the game, and how to play it. After clicking start, the game will begin.
The game will have a settings/menu button. Clicking on it opens a panel with different features, such as retrying the level, quitting the game (which will redirect you to the map), and exiting the settings.
At this point, you can navigate to whichever level you want and play any level you want. Each level will contain a page of notes, filled with the information needed to pass the level. After reading the notes, you can click next. You will then see a page containing the info about how to play the game. Click next to start the game.

After completing the game, you will be transported back to the main menu, where you can choose a different topic to learn and have fun with. Enjoy!

<hi>Downloading and running the program</h1>
There are two ways you can download, and run the program.
<ol><li>Download the .exe file.<br>
This is the simplest way to download the program. All you need to do is go to our git repository, linked <a href='https://github.com/JasonGrace2282/Music-Ascension'>here</a>, and look in the code folder. You should find a .exe file called MusicAscension.exe. Download that file. Once it has finished downloading, all you have to do is open the file and it will run the program!</li>
<li>Clone the git repository<br>
Another way you can run the program is by cloning the git repository. To do that, you first go to our git repositry, linked <a href='https://github.com/JasonGrace2282/Music-Ascension'>here</a>, and click on code. Underneath, you will find an option that says download ZIP. Click that and put the folder in a location that is easy to remember where it is. Right click on the folder and click extract all, and choose your extraction location. After that, you can open your IDE of choice, and open up the extracted files. It will have two important folders: code and resources. Opening the resources folder shows you the images and audio in the game. However, to run the code, you must open the code folder and open main.py . Running that file will run the program. Enjoy!</li></ol>
