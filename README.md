<h1> How to Play?</h1>
Map of different islands - 4 or 5 - where a few are locked at the beginning depending on skill level.

Each island has different minigames based on the overarching lesson.
Each minigame has a percentage of completion, and completing one gets you to another level in that subject. What does it mean to complete a mini game?  To complete a minigame is to answer enough questions to get to the end of 2-3 levels, which are the same thing but with different difficulties.

Finishing a subject gives you an item and getting all(probably 2) items lets you fight the boss.
